# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Bluespec-generated hardware project implementing a transcendental unit. The codebase consists of synthesized Verilog RTL files generated from Bluespec System Verilog (BSV).

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **mkTranscendentalUnit** (rtl/mkTranscendentalUnit.v)
   - Main transcendental computation unit
   - Implements a pipelined architecture with 7+ stages
   - Interface:
     - Input: 32-bit floating point value (`enq_x`) and 3-bit function selector (`enq_func`)
     - Output: 32-bit result via `deq` method
   - Uses multiple FIFO stages for pipelining (stage1_fifo through stage7_fifo)
   - Contains a 200-bit register for storing 2/Ï€ constant (`two_over_pi_reg`)

2. **FIFOL1** (rtl/FIFOL1.v)
   - Single-depth FIFO implementation
   - Allows simultaneous enqueue and dequeue operations
   - Parameterizable width
   - Used as building blocks in the pipelined stages

## Development Notes

- The Verilog files are auto-generated by Bluespec Compiler (version 2025.01.1)
- No build scripts, testbenches, or simulation files are currently present in the repository
- The design uses BSV preprocessor directives for configuration (BSV_POSITIVE_RESET, BSV_ASYNC_RESET, etc.)
- The transcendental unit appears to compute mathematical functions based on the 3-bit function selector

## Common Tasks

Since this is generated RTL without build infrastructure, typical tasks would include:
- Creating testbenches for verification
- Setting up simulation environment (ModelSim, VCS, etc.)
- Synthesis and implementation flow setup
- Adding assertions and formal verification

## Coding Style

- Avoid using excessive print statements
